Exploring how you can use your business to serve God.

There are plenty of resources out there for Christians, and plenty more for entrepreneurs and business owners, but there is very little addressing the unique challenges and difficult questions that a Christian business owner faces.

My name is Michael, and my desire is that this group is a place where you can come to learn more about these unique challenges and discuss with others who are facing the exact same challenges that you are.

Who is a Marketplace Disciple?

Any Christian business owner that wants to learn more about how faith and business work together for God's kingdom.

Whether you are a freelancer, solopreneur, or own a business with 2 or 200 employees (or 2000), this is the place for you.

But, if you don't care about using your business to glorify God and want to keep it separate from your faith, you are in the wrong place.

What is this group for?

For discussing the hard questions that come up when you want your faith to transform your business, such as:
- How can I use this business as a ministry?
- Is it biblical to pursue success in my business?
- What does it mean to be a good steward as a business owner?
- How should we think about profits?
- Does God want me or my money?
- and so many more!

What is this group NOT for?

This group is not a place to learn how to improve your business or promote it. There are plenty of other Facebook groups and websites online that are meant specifically for that, this is not one of them.

What do we believe in?

We believe that God has called us into business as a way to serve in God's kingdom. We want to explore and understand more about how we can do that.

Our long-term vision is to not just discuss these things, but to create lasting change that will transform businesses and the Marketplace Disciples who make them work.

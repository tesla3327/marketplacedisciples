              <p class="card__summary">Nyk Andrusiak is a real estate agent, as well as a partner in a brand new property management company. He lives in Steinbach, Manitoba, with his wife and two kids. After talking with him a bit, I discovered that he’s not a fan of long road trips. He describes it as being, “stuck in a shipping container going across the ocean”.</p>

He shares how God was testing and growing his faith during that time, and the many ways in which God provided for him and his family.</p>

              <p class="card__summary">Nyk also shares the story of how his musical talent, a film producer, and an unexpected cheque - a very large one! - paved the way for his jump into real estate.</p> -->

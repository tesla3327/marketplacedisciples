        <p>“I’ve learned that while I would love to feel 100% “ready” for what God has in mind for me, I will never truly feel ready.  There’s never a “perfect” time for anything.</p>
        <p>The good news, is that I can rely on God to provide and support me during times when I do feel fearful or afraid.”</p>

      <p>Melissa Mathers is a business coach who lives in southern Ontario. A few years ago she started a tutoring business, and as that took off she realized she had a talent for business, and a passion for empowering women entrepreneurs.</p>

      <p>In this interview, Melissa discusses the tension between having confidence in your own abilities, and relying on God to work through you. She shares her thoughts on how Christian business owners should think about profits, and also tells a story of how she decided to step out in faith, even though she didn’t feel completely ready for God’s plan for her.</p>

      <h4 class="h4 h4--question">What is your business?</h4>
      <p>Through my passion for education and love for people, I empower, inspire, and challenge women to breakthrough their limiting beliefs and step into their God-given potential, so they can live with fulfillment and abundance, and the freedom to focus on what matters most.</p>

      <p>I help women overcome fears, self-doubt, and overwhelm. A lot of times, the skills are there, but our mind tries to keep us where we are. It is all about inspiring confidence, and encouraging them to step out of their comfort zone. Often the “pot is almost boiling”, and it just takes that extra push to really get going. Many women have fears about getting visible online, so I help them with the strategies to do this, and also the confidence that they are capable.</p>

      <p>I’ve connected with women who primarily run online service based businesses (other coaches - life coaches, wellness coaches, business coaches, confidence + mindset coaches, financial empowerment coaches), also copywriters, sales and marketing strategists, social media strategists, real estate & travel agents.</p>

      <p>I love educating women and sharing what I’ve learned along the way.  I want to share the message that as a woman with many strengths and experiences, you are capable of more than you think. Whatever you’re dreaming about, you can get there. My favourite quote is by Napoleon Hill: “Whatever the mind can conceive and believe, it can achieve.”</p>

      <h4 class="h4 h4--question">What is it that matters most to you? What matters most to the women you work with?</h4>

      <p>To answer this question, it all comes down to CORE VALUES. For me, my core values are Family, Faith, and Freedom. For me, what matters most is the flexibility to spend time with my family, so I can raise my kids in a God-honoring way.  The reason why I went into business was to teach, inspire, mentor, and make an impact, on my own terms, without sacrificing my family life.  I think “having it all” means having the freedom and flexibility to choose.  I’ve developed an energized rhythm throughout the day so I’m not burning out with work, but maximizing the time I do have.</p>

      <p>What matters most to the women I work with varies, but I’ve noticed themes: family, freedom, faith, empowered, purposeful, confidence, fun, and adventurous.  Some women have goals to leave their 9-5, “retire” their husbands, stay home with their kids, or travel the world.</p>

      <h4 class="h4 h4--question">How did you get started?</h4>

      <p>Before my kids were born, (4 years ago) I was a classroom teacher, supply teaching and doing LTOs. I taught grade 8 for a year in Oakville.  Like many teachers in Ontario, I craved impact + a full time permanent position.</p>

      <p>However, the long “wait” to find my own classroom, in addition to my commute and education politics - left me wanting more fulfillment and impact.  There was a missing piece in my career; I was living in the “safe” zone of classroom teaching - and I just knew there was a whole world outside of the classroom available to me.</p>

      <p>When my son was young, I decided to start tutoring out of my home.  Within months I became “fully booked” and soon after, my husband and I expanded the business to serve more families in Kitchener Waterloo.  We teamed up with other Ontario Certified Teachers and created Tutor-Link - where we connect families with teachers.</p>

      <p>As I operated this business, I again felt pulled towards more.  I wanted to empower and inspire women specifically to step out of their safety net, and find fulfilling, flexible work, so they had options in their career too. I desired to make a lasting impact on the lives of women.</p>

      <p>I also loved the “business” side of my tutoring business and realized that I can create a business that uses my favourite skills. I saw capable, incredible women not maximizing their potential and skills - and I felt this burning desire to help them.</p>

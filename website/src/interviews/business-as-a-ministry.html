<p>
Do you believe that God can work through businesses?
</p>
<p>
Here at <a class="link" href="http://marketplacedisciples.com">Marketplace Disciples</a> I have been interviewing Christian business leaders about how their faith changes the way they run and operate their businesses, and it's been a fascinating ride so far.
</p>
<p>
One of the questions I have been asking each of my guests is, "How do you run your business like a ministry?"
</p>
<p>
I decided to gather up all of their answers into one convenient spot, so here they are!
</p>

<h4 class="h4">Bill Fuchs</h4>
<div class="article__anchor" id="bill-fuchs"></div>

<p>
Bill Fuchs runs a property cleaning service, and has been doing so for the past 11 years. He enjoys providing support for men in his church, whether it is giving them rides or just going out for coffee.
</p>
<h5 class="h5">How do you run your business like a ministry?</h5>


<p>
The ministry comes from providing jobs for people who may not otherwise have a job.
</p>
<p>
I also make sure that the business has a ministry by ensuring that I take the time to provide excellent service that people can depend on and that makes their lives easier. 
</p>
<p>
I will also listen to people. At times, it is appropriate to pray with them or offer other kinds of support.
</p>
<h5 class="h5">Does trying to provide jobs to people who need them affect your hiring process?</h5>


<p>
I don't think it affects the hiring process. It is rather the people I look for or choose.
</p>
<p>
My first step when I need someone is to ask people I know if they have any suggestions. If not, I advertise.
</p>
<p>
During the interview process we listen to the skills but also the needs. 
</p>
<p>
Some people are unable to find work since they were homeless or are new to Canada, but they still have good skills and are willing to learn.

<h4 class="h4">Melissa Mather</h4>
<div class="article__anchor" id="melissa-mather"></div>
<p>
Melissa Mather is a business coach who lives in southern Ontario.
</p>
<p>
A few years ago she started a tutoring business, and as that took off she realized she had a talent for business, and a passion for empowering women entrepreneurs.
</p>
<h5 class="h5">How do you run your business like a ministry?</h5>


<p>
Part of my story is being a Christian - so I'm ok with sharing scripture as part of my marketing and message.
</p>
<p>
I'm always an "open book" with potential clients. I will share scripture on Instagram or Facebook, and tie my faith in with my business in that way.
</p>
<p>
I hope that coaching can be a space and opportunity to make a lasting impact on women's lives as I share my faith with them.

<h4 class="h4">Gary Gehiere</h4>
<div class="article__anchor" id="gary-gehiere"></div>
<p>
Gary does accounting and consulting for a large client base of loyal customers. Although his journey is unconventional, his faith in God through the ups and downs is inspiring.
</p>
<h5 class="h5">Do you think of your business as a ministry?</h5>


<p>
I see my business more as a calling than a ministry. I try to meet the needs that present themselves almost daily. Where spiritual tools are more appropriate, I reach into my toolbox and usually choose prayer.
</p>
<h5 class="h5">How do you run your business like a ministry?</h5>


<p>
Meeting real people with real needs is a special opportunity for all of us, but in business, you have more control over your time and agenda.
</p>
<p>
A word of caution: make sure you do not violate professional ethics or unduly use your influence or authority. Praying with a client may be some of the best counsel we can offer, but always get permission before doing this.

<h4 class="h4">Jannice Moore</h4>
<div class="article__anchor" id="jannice-moore"></div>

<p>
Jannice is the owner of a small company that <a class="link" href="http://governancecoach.com/">provides coaching to governing boards</a>, specializing in teaching a servant-leadership style of governance.
</p>
<p>
This gives her and her 11 employees a very natural way to present Jesus to her clients.
</p>
<h5 class="h5">Do you think of your business as a ministry?</h5>


<p>
Yes, I do consider my business a ministry.
</p>
<h5 class="h5">How do you run your business like a ministry?</h5>


<p>
In a broad sense, helping boards to more effectively direct their organizations to achieve their missions contributes to making the world a better place. 
</p>
<p>
The model of governance in which my business specializes is Policy Governance ®. One of its fundamental principles is that the board is not there for itself, but for its owners – those on whose behalf it governs – and that the board's relationship with those owners should be one of servant-leadership.
</p>
<p>
So, I build the concept of servant-leadership into every presentation, and use it as an opportunity to note that the concept was one taught by Jesus Christ.

</p>
<h5 class="h5">Do you think of your business as a ministry?</h5>


<p>
Although it has taken time, I do see my business as a ministry.
</p>
<p>
I believe that through my relationships with my clients, employees and subtrades, I can make an impact for God's kingdom.
</p>
<h5 class="h5">How do you run your business like a ministry?</h5>


<p>
How we respond to challenges can either bring glory to God or damage our witness.
</p>
<p>
The area I struggle with is in personal evangelism to those in my network and this is an area I desire to grow in.

<p>
I do think of my business as a ministry because it is what God called me to do.
</p>
<h5 class="h5">How do you run your business like a ministry?</h5>


<p>
I'm to minister not only to the hurting that find their way to my door, but also to the therapists and other business professionals I meet during the journey.
</p>
<p>
My job is to let my light shine before others so that they may see my good works and give glory to my Father who is in heaven.

<h4 class="h4">Joe Peristy</h4>
<div class="article__anchor" id="joe-peristy"></div>

<p>
Unlike most of the others interviewed here, Joe does not own a business. He leads in the marketplace in a different way.
</p>
<p>
He is a project manager at the multi-national engineering firm AECOM. He's managed projects involving only a few million dollars of capital, all the way to huge projects worth several hundred million dollars.
</p>
<h5 class="h5">Do you think of your occupation as a ministry?</h5>


<p>
First off, work is a ministry as it is ordained by God – we are not to be idle.
</p>
<h5 class="h5">How do you treat your occupation like a ministry?</h5>


<p>
The engineering profession is generally God in action, practically in the world. We work behind the scenes to provide you (the lay person) everything. Everything you have has been engineered in some way from your phone, house, car, road, water, and electricity.
</p>
<p>

Running it like a ministry is easy.
</p>
<p>
You see, God is interested in people, and people make a business succeed or not succeed. Apply biblical principles to all your interactions including work ones.
</p>
<p>
This includes ethics, integrity, honesty, charity, empathy, listening, caring, discipling, correcting, and encouragement. All biblical principles are required in business when dealing with staff, clients and the public.
</p>
<p>

Furthering God's Kingdom is an evangelical truism – like we have some obligation or something we can contribute. We do not contribute to our salvation or to the salvation of others. God does it all, is in all and through all. We just trust and obey and be Christ-like in the world – that is how we further the Kingdom.
</p>
<p>
Show those traits I expounded on above and the fruits of the spirit. Be quick to respond if asked why we believe what we do – then we point to God.
</p>
<p>
That is in any part of life, not just business.
</p>
<p>
In other words, the business furthers God's kingdom by the people who behave like Christians and are Christians.

</p>
<h5 class="h5">How do you run your business like a ministry?</h5>


<p>
Through a value driven and integrity based business, I aim to emulate godliness in all my interactions with my clients.
</p>
<p>
That, and introducing God and church whenever the opportunity is presented to me.

Peter is also an employee, but that doesn't make him any less of a Marketplace Disciple.
</p>

He works at a software company owned and operated by Christians, where part of his responsibilties include telling clients about Christ.
</p>
<h5 class="h5">Do you think of your occupation as a ministry?</h5>


<p>
Yes, a Christian's occupation is definitely a ministry.
</p>
<h5 class="h5">How do you treat your occupation like a ministry?</h5>


<p>
I see this as being achieved in two ways:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>As a Christian, I owe my superiors loyalty and have a responsibility to represent God well; both in how I interact with my co-workers and how I occupy my time.
    <li>Since I am a Christian in a business operated by Christians, it is easy to extend the previous into our interaction and business dealings with our clients. Specifically, we will not cheat or take advantage of them nor do we lie to them to make ourselves look better.</li>
</ol>

<h4 class="h4">Joel Koops</h4>
<div class="article__anchor" id="joel-koops"></div>

<p>
Joel owns MSW Plastics, a PVC extrusion company that primarily manufactures products for the construction industry, located in Palmerston, ON, Canada.
</p>
<h5 class="h5">Do you think of your business as a ministry?</h5>


<p>
Yes, our business is a ministry.
</p>
<h5 class="h5">How do you run your business like a ministry?</h5>


<p>
This happens in various ways - in the way we treat others, in the way we value people in and out of our company, and in the way we act and live out our values and ethics.
</p>
<p>
I grew up learning how the sovereignty of God should be evident in all the spheres of our lives, and that includes business. I believe that we can't be Christians in only certain parts of our lives – that our faith should exude in all areas.
</p>
<p>
In our business, we work on trying to value each person that is part of it, giving them the respect they deserve. This does not mean everything always works out the way we want it to. However, it can mean that people feel valued and part of something positive.
</p>
<p>
We also commit to a safe and stable workplace, in which all members of the team are enabled to grow and learn together.
</p>
<p>
I believe that our business is a vehicle to further God's kingdom. Our responsibility is to be good stewards of the resources and profits that have been entrusted to us.

  "summary": "In the bible there is a classic picture of <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.gotquestions.org/Jesus-washing-feet.html\">Jesus washing the feet</a> of the apostles. He takes this position of a servant throughout his ministry â€“ his ultimate service to us was on the cross.<br /><br /> He teaches us that we need to serve others, no matter our position in life."

        Gary had failed.
        </p>
        <p>
        In that way, he is not much different than me or you.
        </p>
        <p>
        But instead of packing it in &mdash; as we so often do &mdash; he listened to God's call on his life to push through that failure.
        </p>
        <p>
        Gary does accounting and consulting for a large client base of loyal customers. Although his journey is unconventional, his faith in God through the ups and downs is inspiring.
        </p>
        <p>
        In this interview he talks about how he started his own firm, how he makes faith-based decisions, and how he uses prayer to minister to others through his business.

        <h4 class="h4">What is your business?</h4>


        <p>
        I work in the field of accounting, tax and business consulting.
        </p>
        <h4 class="h4">How did you get started?</h4>


        <p>
        I started out as an articling student, employed full time with a national firm of chartered accountants. I was taking correspondence courses from Queens, doing summer sessions, and writing three days of exams each year. The whole process lasted for 5 years.
        </p>
        <p>
        Nonetheless, not all who go through this process end up succeeding.
        </p>
        <p>
        I was one of the ones who failed.
        </p>
        <p>
        And when you fail for the first time in your life, after investing the best years of your life, it is a moment of crisis. I regrouped, and without a designation, carried on as a staff auditor for eight more years.
        </p>
        <p>
        The work offered little personal satisfaction.
        </p>
        <p>
        And although I was an active believer in Jesus, there was a separation between my faith and the tough issues of life. I "toughed it out" until one day, I reached the end. Something had to give.
        </p>

        <div class="article__quote">
            <p>I’m happy just knowing the next step, not the whole picture</p>
        </div>

        <p>
        I prayed. The answer came quickly.
        </p>
        <p>
        The word from the Lord for me came in a short phrase from the story of Moses being called to lead Israel and feeling unprepared and unqualified. The Lord said "what is that in thine hand?"
        </p>
        <p>
        In that moment I realized the value of who I was and what I had been given.
        </p>
        <p>
        I realized that although none of my efforts would be valued on a CV, when given to God, they would be invaluable. In that moment, I accepted my call to help people using my training in accounting.
        </p>
        <p>
        I gave notice, left the firm, and within days had my own clients!
        </p>
        <p>
        So today, 45 years later, I continue. The orders still stand. I have a large client base, including several who have been with me from the beginning.
        </p>
        <h4 class="h4">If you want, can you explain a bit about your faith journey?</h4>


        <p>
        Studies show that when surveyed, the majority of confessing Christians became believers between the ages of 4 and 14.
        </p>
        <p>
        That was true for me, influenced by a neighbourhood Bible Club, and a local church that presented the importance of a personal salvation experience.
        </p>
        <p>
        I have clear memories of key events in this period of my faith journey. Coming to Jesus in repentance, receiving salvation and being born again &mdash; the essential foundational event on which the rest of life would be lived.
        </p>
        <h4 class="h4">How do you make faith-based decisions?</h4>


        <p>
        Living life for me needs constant, clear direction, but I'm happy just knowing the next step, not the whole picture. If I had to identify just one spiritual privilege that I rank first, it is being able to receive clear direction for the next step.
        </p>
        <p>
        Yes, the act of praying for direction is part of the process. So is reading and assimilating the truths from scripture.
        </p>
        <p>
        But more importantly, the attitude of expectation, the posture of faith, believing, waiting, praying some more, and never giving up &mdash; because God will speak, and clearly.
        </p>
        <p>
        This is essential and a reality for which I am grateful.
        </p>
        <h4 class="h4">Do you think of your business as a ministry?</h4>


        <p>
        I see my business more as a calling than a ministry. I try to meet the needs that present themselves almost daily. Where spiritual tools are more appropriate, I reach into my toolbox and usually choose prayer.
        </p>
        <p>
        Meeting real people with real needs is a special opportunity for all of us, but in business, you have more control over your time and agenda.
        </p>
        <p>
        <strong>A word of caution</strong> &mdash; make sure you do not violate professional ethics or unduly use your influence or authority. Praying with a client may be some of the best counsel we can offer, but always get permission before doing this.
        </p>
        <h4 class="h4">What are some ways in which you run your business differently than someone who is not a believer?</h4>


        <p>
        Being ethical, honest, reliable, and respectful. These are some of the ways.
        </p>
        <p>
        I practice "value billing", but also practice "pro bono" when I determine that the client needs help, but cannot aﬀord the fee.
        </p>
        <h4 class="h4">Should we grow businesses or keep them small? Do you think that faith plays a role in this at all, or is this question irrelevant?</h4>


        <p>
        With God's leading, and without pride, live up to your privileges and opportunities. Riches can be a snare, but offer real opportunities to help others.
        </p>
        <p>
        Providing employment to others is helping in a very real way.
        </p>
        <h4 class="h4">Do you struggle with the ethics of selling and marketing? What has helped you with this?</h4>


        <p>
        If you have the ability to genuinely meet a need, and you meet a prospect who has the need that you can meet, the prospect will be excited to have found you.
        </p>
        <p>
        Marketing is the attempt to make the connection. Honesty and integrity are essential for a successful outcome.
        </p>
        <h4 class="h4">Is there a time when you really had to rely on God for something, when you have had to make a "leap of faith"?</h4>


        <p>
        Usually, the leap was made first and then I had to rely on God for recovery.
        </p>
        <p>
        More than once, and this is especially gratifying, I took a leap, things went so so, and in the end, an unintended consequence turned out to be the real blessing.
        </p>
        <h4 class="h4">How do you think about work/life balance?</h4>


        <p>
        First of all, work is your friend, not your enemy.
        </p>
        <p>
        It is a privilege to work. Work brings a wonderful sense of satisfaction. If it isn't that way for you, pray and ask God to change you, what you do, or who you work for.
        </p>
        <p>
        Second, since that day I recounted earlier, I have always integrated my work with family and with life. This works for me. Enjoy the journey.
        </p>
        <h4 class="h4">What habit have you developed over the years that you think others would benefit from having?</h4>


        <p>
        Don't try to do everything yourself.
        </p>
        <p>
        Do what you do best and hire the rest. Appreciate your staff and your clients. Enjoy the journey. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Expect God to show you the next step and He will.
        </p>

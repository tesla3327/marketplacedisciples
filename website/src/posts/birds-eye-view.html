  Have you ever seen one of the first online magazines? At the dawn of the internet, they were terrible.
  </p>
  <p>
  The internet was a new-fangled thing, so people would take their existing printed magazines, scan them, and then post all of the images on their website. It was a nightmare to try and read, and you certainly couldn't search for anything.
  </p>
  <p>
  If you go the Times website right now though, you'll find something far different.
  </p>
  <p>
  They have <strong>hyper-optimized their website to match the strengths (and weaknesses) of the internet</strong>. The website changes its layout based on the size of your screen, and even the ads that are shown change based on what they know about you — it is so much more advanced than 1995.
  </p>
  <p>
  But what does the beginning of the internet and the modern New York Times have to do with Marketplace Disciples?
  </p>
  <h4 class="h4">Beginning with the end in mind</h4>
  
  
  <p>
  My ultimate goal with Marketplace Disciples is to create something that will encourage and enable Christian business owners to use their business to further God's kingdom.
  </p>
  <p>
  Simple to say, but then there is the problem of actually accomplishing that goal.
  </p>
  <p>
  This is how I plan to do it.
  </p>
  <h4 class="h4">Into Cyberspace We Go</h4>
  
  
  <p>
  In doing anything it is important to ask yourself, "what am I uniquely capable of doing?". It's Business 101. If I can't add value to Christian business owners like yourself, then I'm wasting my time.
  </p>
  <p>
  So what is it that I can bring to the table? What unique strengths do I have?
  </p>
  <p>
  I believe it is my ability to <strong>fully</strong> embrace what the internet enables us to do. Not just taking something offline and putting it online — that's just shoving a square peg into a round hole.
  </p>
  <p>
  At my day job I am a software engineer, so I spend my whole day with technology. I understand software, and I understand what the internet enables us to do. It's my entire world.
  </p>
  <p>
  But as Christians, we suck at technology.
  </p>
  <p>
  We're still stuck at the 1995 online magazine, when we should be the 2018 Times website — hyper-optimzed for what the internet enables us to do.
  </p>
  <h4 class="h4">Digital missionaries? That's not a thing</h4>
  <p>
  If you don't believe me, think about this.
  </p>
  <p>
  We spend all this time and money sending people to foriegn countries to speak with people, and we spend time and money on local outreach. Money and time well spent, I would say.
  </p>
  <p>
  Except that people are increasingly spending their time online. So where is the Church's online presence?
  </p>
  <p>
  Missionaries don't have to travel to foreign countries and exotic locations, but they also don't have to be missionaries in a physical sense. Why not send people to be missionaries on the internet?
  </p>
  <p>
  I am sure that the concept of a "digital missionary" sounds weird to you, but why should it?
  </p>
  <h4 class="h4">3 Smallish Steps for Mankind (and Christian business owners more specifically)</h4>
  <p>
    My goal is to tackle this problem for the Christian business owner. To more fully embrace what the internet enables us to do.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are great resources out there, but far fewer than there should be. I'm not saying I'll be able to solve this single-handledly, but hopefully I'll be able to make a dent, God willing.
    </p>
  <p>
  So this is part of what my vision for what the future holds.
  </p>
  <h5 class="h5">1.&nbsp;&nbsp; A thriving online community of Christian business owners who are eager to learn more about how they can apply their faith to their business.</h5>
  
  
  <p>
  We have had local meetings of business owners for decades, but why do we need to be constrained by geography? (Answer: we don't)
  </p>
  <h5 class="h5">2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Deep collection of resources and teachings on practical issues that face Christian business owners.</h5>
  
  
  <p>
  How do you start a bible study with your employees? What does it look like to disciple them? How do you deal with competition and grow your business in a God honouring way? <strong>Does God want you to be rich?</strong>
  </p>
  <h5 class="h5">3.&nbsp;&nbsp; Stories of other Christian business owners</h5>
  
  
  <p>
  At times this job can be lonely, and it's so encouraging to read about others, their struggles, successes, and how their faith radically changes the way they do business.

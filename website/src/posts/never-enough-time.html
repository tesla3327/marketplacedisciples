  I never feel like I have enough time to work on Marketplace Disciples.
  </p>
  <p>
  Do I not care enough? Maybe I'm just too lazy.
  </p>
  <p>
  My life is full of wonderful things, things that all take up time:
  </p><ul>
  
  <li>My career (which is necessary for me to live)
  <li>Wife, friends, and family
  <li>Church obligations, like doing sound on Sunday mornings and helping with youth</li></ul>
  
  <p>
  Sure, I put in a few hours here and there when I can, but it ends up being less than 5 hours per week. According to "blogging experts", you need to put in far more than that to get anywhere.
  </p>
  <p>
  They do have a point though. This has turned out to be far more complicated than I ever could have imagined it would be (which I'll share more on in a bit). I'm finding that the amount of time I put in is not enough to "keep up". What does it even mean to "keep up"?
  </p>
  <p>
  Perhaps I'm just not very effective in my use of time.
  </p>
  <p>
  This bothers me a lot, since "productivity" as a topic is something that I've spent a lot of time learning and experimenting with, all throughout university and into my career.
  </p>
  <p>
  I do believe that God has called me to this, and so I want to do it to the best of my ability. I know that we grow through challenges, and good things come through hard work. This is just more difficult than I want it to be.
  </p>
  <h4 class="h4">I thought this would be easy</h4>
  
  
  <p>
  Well, I thought it would be a lot <em>easier </em>than it has proven to be.
  </p>
  <p>
  I got into this knowing that building a blog, marketing it, promoting it, and growing it would be ridiculously hard. Probably more difficult than anything else I've ever done. This is largely due to the fact that I have to figure out everything as I go, and there are no "right" answers.
  </p>
  <p>
  My plan from the beginning was to have interviews of different Christian business owners as the basis for everything. My assumption — now shown to be wildly incorrect — was that I didn't have to create any content myself, since it was being created for me by the people I interviewed.
  </p>
  <p>
  This naive assumption is laughable to me now. I can't even comprehend why it made sense to me 18 months ago!
  </p>
  <p>
  I've now realized that in addition to keeping up a blog, along with all of it's challenges and time-consuming tasks, I have also taken on the challenge of finding and interviewing others, which is at least as much work as the blog itself.
  </p>
  <h4 class="h4">It's going to be a long road</h4>
  
  
  <p>
  I have no intention of quitting or letting this fall by the wayside.
  </p>
  <p>
  I have received emails from several of you saying how encouraging this site is, and if there are a few, there are many more out there who can benefit from this.
  </p>
  <p>
  Since trying to be more disciplined and systematic in how I put in the time hasn't worked well, I'm doubtful it will at all. Instead, I'm trying to readjust how I think about Marketplace Disciples, and figure out ways in which I can make it fit into the space and time that I have for it, instead of the other way around.
  </p>
  <p>
  I have a vision for Marketplace Disciples, and so many ideas on what it could become. It will be a tough, long, slog to get there, but we'll get there.

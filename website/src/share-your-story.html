        <h4 class="h4">Do I qualify for an interview?</h4>
        <p>I interview all sorts of Christian business owners and entrepreneurs (freelancers, too!)</p>
        <p>If you love the Lord and run a business, you're qualified. Whether you have 2 employees or 200 (or even 2000), or you're on your own, it doesn't matter. If you've been doing this for 40 years, or for a few months, you are qualified.</p>
        <p>Even if you don't run a business, but have a unique professional experience (such as being in upper management), you qualify.</p>
        <p>Marketplace Disciples becomes a lot more interesting the more diverse the interviews are, so I'd love to have you on board!</p>

        <h4 class="h4">How much work do I have to put in?</h4>
        <p>You can put in as little or as much time into this as you want. I aim to keep my process flexible and to make you as comfortable as possible.</p>

        <h4 class="h4">How long does it take?</h4>
        <p>The whole process can last several weeks from beginning to end, largely dependent on how many other interviews I have going on at the time, and how busy I am otherwise (I do this in my spare time, after all).</p>
        <p>However, the process is based around email, so you are never actually waiting around. It's just a matter of how quickly we are responding to each other's emails.</p>

        <h4 class="h4">What is the process?</h4>
        <p><strong>NOTE: I will NEVER publish anything that you are not comfortable with.</strong></p>
        <p>First, I will send you some questions by email, and you can take your time answering them. Write as little or as much as you want, there is no specific length I am looking for.</p>
        <p>Based on these answers I will send you back some follow up questions. These questions allow me to dive a little deeper.</p>
        <p>Once I receive the last set of answers I will edit the interview and send it back to you for review.</p>
        <p>Finally, when you have given me the thumbs up on the interview I will publish it on the site!</p>

        <h4 class="h4">Contact me</h4>
        <p>Send me an email and let me know you would like to do an interview.</p>
        <p>You can contact me at: <a class="link" href="mailto:michael@marketplacedisciples.com">michael@marketplacedisciples.com</a></p>
